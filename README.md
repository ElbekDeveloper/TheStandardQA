> "0.1.1.1 Articulation\nDescribing the observable is an art in and of itself because describing a problem well is halfway to its solution. The clearer the articulation of the problem is, the more likely the problem is to be understood by others helping us to solve that very same problem.\n\nArticulation isn't always with words. It's also with figures and shapes. It is not an accident that some of the most advanced ancient cultures have used figures and shapes to describe their times and history. Figures are a universal language, understood and interpreted by anyone who can relate to them much faster than learning a spoken language. A figure or shape might be the most optimum way to illustrate an idea, as its pictures are worth thousands of words.\n\nArticulation requires a passion for solving the issue. Whether it's written, spoken, or illustrated. A passionate mind shall convey the hidden message of the criticality of the problem to be solved. Articulating a problem is a big part of how one can sell a solution. Our ability to convey an idea to other engineers and those who will be investing and using this solution is one of the most critical aspects of engineering software.

 "Abstraction helps in achieving loose coupling between different components of a system by hiding the implementation details of the dependencies, allowing the components to communicate through well-defined interfaces and reducing the impact of changes made to the dependencies on the other components."

> "What is the role of foundation/broker-neighboring services in achieving abstraction?

 "The role of foundation/broker-neighboring services is to ensure a level of abstraction exists between the brokers and the rest of the system, to offer a layer of validation on top of existing operations, and to play the role of a mapper for all other native models and contracts needed to complete any given operation while interfacing with a broker."

> "What is the purpose of the abstraction layer between foundation services and brokers?

 "The purpose of the abstraction layer between foundation services and brokers is to ensure the pure business logic layer in any system is verbally and functionally agnostic to whichever dependencies the system is relying on to communicate with the outside world."

> "How does the contract between a processing or orchestration service and a foundation service stay the same, regardless of the type of broker used?

 "The contract between a processing or orchestration service and a foundation service stays the same because the foundation service abstracts away the native broker operations from the rest of the system, ensuring that the upstream processing service implementation remains unchanged, regardless of whether the foundation service is using a storage, queue, or API broker."

> "Can you provide an example of a foundation service that is implemented with a storage broker?

 "Yes, here's an example of a foundation service that is implemented with a storage broker: \n\npublic async ValueTask<Student> AddStudentAsync(Student student)\n{\n\t...\n\treturn await this.storageBroker.InsertStudentAsync(student);\n
"

 "The AddStudentAsync method is an example of a foundation service that could be used to implement the UpsertStudentAsync functionality in a StudentProcessingService, regardless of whether it is implemented with a storage, queue, or API broker. This illustrates how the abstraction layer between foundation services and brokers enables the upstream processing service implementation to remain unchanged, even if the foundation service uses different types of brokers."

> "Why is the abstraction layer considered an important responsibility for foundation/broker-neighboring services?

 "The abstraction layer is considered an important responsibility for foundation/broker-neighboring services because it ensures that the pure business logic layer in any system is not dependent on the specifics of the brokers being used to communicate with the outside world. This abstraction enables the business logic layer to remain functionally agnostic to these dependencies, making it easier to modify or update the system in the future without having to change the business logic layer."

> "What is deep cloning and why is it important in testing?

 "Deep cloning is creating a copy of an object that has its own memory space, rather than pointing to the same memory location as the original object. This is important in testing to ensure that modifications to the returned object do not affect the original object, and that the expected value remains unchanged."

> "What is a mock in testing, and why is it useful?

 "A mock is a simulated version of a component or dependency that is used in place of the real component in testing. It is useful because it allows tests to run without relying on external dependencies, and can simulate a wide range of behavior for the component in question."

> "What is a test case, and why is it important?

> "What is the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in testing?

 "The Arrange-Act-Assert pattern is a common pattern used in testing that involves three steps: 1) Arranging the necessary preconditions for the test, 2) Acting on the system or component being tested, and 3) Asserting that the system or component behaves as expected. This pattern helps to ensure that tests are well-structured and easy to read."

> "What is regression testing, and why is it important?

 "Regression testing is the process of re-running tests on a system or component after changes have been made, in order to ensure that existing functionality has not been affected. It is important because it helps to catch any errors or bugs that may have been introduced as a result of changes, and ensures that the system continues to behave as expected."

> "What is a test suite, and why is it useful?

 "A test suite is a collection of test cases that are designed to test various aspects of a system or component. It is useful because it allows developers to easily run and manage multiple tests at once, and helps to ensure that all aspects of the system are thoroughly tested."

> "What is the purpose of writing a failing test before implementing a functionality?

 "The purpose of writing a failing test before implementing a functionality is to ensure that the implemented functionality meets the expected requirements of the test. By starting with a failing test, we can define the desired outcome before we start implementing the functionality. This helps to avoid any unforeseen consequences and ensures that the code works as intended."

> "Why is it important to randomize inputs and outputs in tests?

 "It is important to randomize inputs and outputs in tests because it helps to ensure that the test is targeting a certain functional behavior and not just a specific value or set of values. Randomization helps to avoid fooling tests into reporting a successful operation by using specific input parameters or output values. Additionally, randomization is required by default unless there is a strong justification to test for a specific value or set of values."

> "Why do we need to deep clone the expected output in tests?

 "We need to deep clone the expected output in tests to ensure that no modifications have happened to the originally passed in object. If an input object value has changed for any of its attributes internally within the tested function, that change won't trigger a failing test unless we dereference the expected output variable from the input and returned variables. Deep cloning helps to ensure that the test is only testing the expected behavior and nothing else."

> "What should be the scope of the implementation to pass a failing test?

 "The scope of the implementation to pass a failing test should be only enough to satisfy the requirements of the test. The implementation should not do anything more or less than what is required to pass the test. This helps to ensure that the code is not over-engineered and that any additional functionality is only added when required by additional tests."

> "What does the implementation of the AddStudentAsync function do?

 "The implementation of the AddStudentAsync function only calls the InsertStudentAsync function on the storage broker with the passed in student parameter. This implementation satisfies the requirements of the failing test that was previously defined, and is the minimum amount of code required to pass that test."

> "What is the benefit of using mocks in unit tests?

 "The benefit of using mocks in unit tests is that it allows us to isolate and test individual components of the code without the need for any external dependencies. By mocking the response from a storage broker or logging broker, for example, we can ensure that the test is only testing the specific functionality of the component that we are interested in, and not any of the other components that may depend on it. Additionally, using mocks can help to speed up the test execution time by eliminating the need for any external resources."

> "Why is it important to verify all calls and no other calls have been made in unit tests?

 "It is important to verify all calls and no other calls have been made in unit tests to ensure that the code is doing only what is intended and nothing else. By verifying that all the expected calls have been made and no other calls have been made, we can ensure that the code is not doing anything unexpected or unintended. This helps to avoid any potential bugs or security vulnerabilities that could be introduced by unintended functionality."

> "What is the purpose of the StudentService contract?

 "The purpose of the StudentService contract is to define the interface that the StudentService component must implement in order to provide its functionality. The IStudentService interface defines a single function, AddStudentAsync, which takes a Student object as a parameter and returns a ValueTask<Student> object."

> "What is the role of foundation services in a system?

 "Foundation services play the role of a gatekeeper between the system and the outside world to ensure the data that goes through is structurally, logically and externally valid before performing any further operations by upstream services."

 "Structural validations ensure a particular attribute or piece of data doesn't have a default value if it's required. They are used to check for basic data integrity and prevent errors in downstream services."

> "What is the purpose of logical validations?

 "Logical validations compare attributes to other attributes within the same entity or any other entity. They are used to check for more complex data integrity issues and ensure that the data is consistent and conforms to any business rules or constraints."

> "What is the difference between circuit-breaking and continuous validations?

 "Circuit-breaking validations require an immediate exit from the current flow and prevent further operations at that level. Continuous validations, on the other hand, do not stop the flow and are used to provide feedback or warnings about non-critical issues or potential errors."

> "Why is it important to perform validations before communicating with external resources?

 "Performing validations before communicating with external resources helps prevent unnecessary requests and reduces the overall processing time. It also helps to ensure that the data being sent to external resources is structurally, logically, and externally valid, which reduces the risk of errors and improves the overall reliability of the system."

> "What is the purpose of TryCatch in the example code?

 "TryCatch is used to catch any exceptions thrown by the ValidateStudent method and handle them gracefully. If an exception is caught, it will be logged and a generic error message will be returned to the caller. This helps to prevent crashes and improve the overall reliability of the system."

> "What is the benefit of using a TryCatch block in validation code?

 "Using a TryCatch block in validation code helps prevent crashes and improve the overall reliability of the system. It also provides a way to catch and handle errors gracefully, rather than crashing the entire system or returning an obscure error message to the caller."

 "If a processing service needs to perform a task that is unique to the service and not supported by the foundation layer, then the service may need to use a model specific to the service."

> "Why is it important to control the capabilities of a processing service?

 "Controlling the capabilities of a processing service ensures that redundant work is not performed and that the service operates efficiently and effectively within the system."

> "What is an example of a higher-order business logic operation?

 "Ensuring that a particular entity exists before trying to persist it is an example of a higher-order business logic operation."

> "What is the importance of terminology in higher-order business logic routines?

 "Terminology in higher-order business logic routines is important because it controls the expectations of the outcome and the inner functionality, and ensures that engineers require less cognitive resources to understand the underlying capabilities of the routine."

> "What is an example of a redundant capability?

 "TryAddStudentAsync and EnsureStudentExistsAsync, which both perform the same task, are examples of redundant capabilities that could be created mistakenly without a convention in place."

> "What is the importance of mapping models in processing services?

 "Mapping models in processing services is important because it allows for the processing service to convert incoming or outgoing objects with a specific model to its own local model. This allows for the processing service to operate on its own local models while still using the models from the foundation layer."

> "When is it necessary for a processing service to use the exact same model as the foundation layer?

 "If a processing service is operating based on a specific model and there is no need for a special model for that service, then it may be permitted to use the exact same model from the foundation layer."

> "How are exceptions handled in the Standard for processing services?

 "Exceptions in the Standard for processing services are more expressive in their naming conventions and define the what, where, and why of the exception. When an exception occurs from a dependency, processing services will map it to a specific exception in their own local models, depending on the nature of the exception. The exception is then wrapped with a StudentProcessingDependencyException or StudentProcessingServiceException and logged at the Error level."

> "What is the StudentProcessingServiceException and when is it thrown?

 "The StudentProcessingServiceException is an exception that is thrown by a processing service when there is an internal error that is not a validation or dependency issue. It indicates that an error occurred within the processing service."

> "How does the processing service map a StudentDependencyValidationException?

 "When a StudentDependencyValidationException is thrown by a dependency, the processing service will wrap the inner exception with a StudentProcessingDependencyValidationException and log it at the Error level."

> "What is the role of exceptions in the Standard for processing services?

 "Exceptions in the Standard for processing services define the what, where, and why of the exception, allowing for better understanding of errors and issues within the system. They are mapped and wrapped by processing services to allow for more specific and expressive exceptions to be thrown at the service layer."

> "What is the difference between a StudentValidationException and a StudentDependencyValidationException?

 "A StudentValidationException is thrown when there is a validation error with a student entity, while a StudentDependencyValidationException is thrown when there is a validation error with a dependency required by the processing service."

> "How are exceptions from foundation services mapped in processing services?

 "When an exception is thrown by a foundation service, the processing service will map it to a specific exception in their own local models, depending on the nature of the exception. The exception is then wrapped with a StudentProcessingDependencyException or StudentProcessingServiceException and logged at the Error level."


> "What are orchestration services?

 "Orchestration services combine multiple foundation or processing services to perform a complex logical operation. They are responsible for encapsulating operations requiring two or three business entities and delegating dependencies to downstream services."

> "Can you provide an example of how orchestration services work?

 "In the example given, the LibraryCardOrchestrationService calls both the StudentProcessingService and LibraryCardProcessingService to create a library card for a student. This is necessary because the library card service does not have access to all the details about the student, so a combination logic is required to ensure a proper flow is in place."

> "When are orchestration services required?

 "Orchestration services are only required if we need to combine multi-entity operations, which can be primitive or higher-order."

> "Why might some architectures not include orchestration services?

 "In some architectures, orchestration services might not even exist because some microservices might be responsible for applying validation logic and persisting and retrieving data from storage, no more or no less."

> "Orchestration services' primary responsibility is

 "encapsulating operations requiring two or three business entities."

> "The operation of creating a library card for a given student cannot be performed by

 "simply calling the library card service."

> "What are orchestration services?

 "Orchestration services are services responsible for combining multiple foundation or processing services to perform complex logical operations. They delegate the dependencies of those operations to downstream services and are primarily responsible for encapsulating operations requiring two or three business entities. They're only required when multi-entity operations need to be combined."

> "What is an example of using an orchestration service?

 "An example of using an orchestration service is when the LibraryCardOrchestrationService calls both the StudentProcessingService and LibraryCardProcessingService to verify a student's existence, enrollment, and create a library card. This complex operation cannot be performed by a single library card service as it does not have access to all the details of the student."

> "What is the position of orchestration services in a system?

 "Orchestration services are positioned between single entity services (such as processing or foundation) and advanced logic services such as coordination services, aggregation services, or simply exposers such as controllers web components or anything else."

> "What are the dependencies and consumers of orchestration services?

 "Orchestration services have dependencies on processing and foundation services, and they may have consumers such as coordination services, aggregation services, or exposers such as controllers, view services, UI components, or another foundation or processing service."

> "When is a processing service required for an orchestration service?

 "The existence of an orchestration service warrants the presence of a processing service, but there are situations where all orchestration services need to finalize a business flow to interact with primitive-level functionality without a processing service."

> "What are some examples of consumers of orchestration services?

 "Some examples of consumers of orchestration services include coordination services, aggregation services, or exposers such as controllers, view services, and UI components."

> "Orchestration services are one of the core business logic components in any system, positioned between

 "single entity services (such as processing or foundation) and advanced logic services such as coordination services, aggregation services, or simply exposers such as controllers web components or anything else."

> "An Orchestration service could have several consumers, such as

 "coordination services (orchestrators of orchestrators), aggregation services or simply an exposer."

> "What is the position of orchestration services in a system's core business logic components?

 "Orchestration services are positioned between single entity services such as processing or foundation, and advanced logic services such as coordination services or aggregation services. They are one of the core business logic components in any system."

> "What are the dependencies and consumers of an orchestration service?

 "Orchestration services have dependencies on processing services and potentially other foundation services. They can have multiple consumers, such as coordination services (orchestrators of orchestrators), aggregation services, or simply an exposer like controllers, view services, or UI components."

> "What is the main purpose of orchestration services?

 "Orchestration services are responsible for combining multiple single-entity primitive or higher-order business logic operations to execute a successful flow, acting as the glue that ties them together."

> "What is the role of language in orchestration services?

 "Language is important in defining the level of complexity and capabilities offered by orchestration services. Functions within orchestration services tend to use a more holistic language that inches closer to a business language than a technical one."

> "In general, orchestration services are concerned with

 "combining single-entity primitive or higher-order business logic operations to execute a successful flow."

> "Orchestration services offer functionality that inches closer and closer to a business language than

 "primitive technical operation."

> "What is the main purpose of orchestration services?

 "The main purpose of orchestration services is to combine single-entity primitive or higher-order business logic operations to execute a successful flow, acting as the glue that ties multiple single-entity operations together."

> "What is the common characteristic of the language used in orchestration services?

 "Orchestration services have a language that is wholistic in most of its functions, offering functionality that resembles a business language rather than just technical operations. This becomes even more apparent as one moves to higher and more advanced categories of services within the realm of business logic."

> "What is the language used in Orchestration services?

 "The language used in Orchestration services defines the level of complexity and capabilities it offers. Orchestration services are wholistic in most of the language of its function, offering functionality that inches closer and closer to a business language than primitive technical operation. They have a common characteristic regarding the language of their functions, where you may see almost an identical expression in a non-technical business requirement matching a function name in an orchestration service."

> "What is Pass-Through in Orchestration services?

 "Orchestration services can be a pass-through for some operations, allowing an operation to be propagated through the service to unify the source of interactions with the system at the exposers level. In this case, orchestration services will use the same terminology a processing or foundation service may use to propagate the operation."

> "How are Orchestration services named?

 "Orchestration services mainly combine multiple operations supporting a particular entity. So, the name of the orchestration service would reflect its primary entity, for example, 'StudentOrchestrationService' if the primary entity is 'Student'. The opposite is also true, if enrolling a student in a school has associated operations such as creating a library card, then in this case, a 'StudentOrchestrationService' must exist to create a 'Student' and all other related entities. The same idea applies to all exceptions created in an orchestration service."

> "What is the range of dependencies for Orchestration services?

 "Orchestration services may have a more extensive range of dependencies than Processing and Foundation services, ranging from foundation services or optional processing services to cross-cutting services such as logging or other utility brokers. This is due to the optionality of Processing services."

> "Orchestration services have a common characteristic regarding the language of their functions.

 "You will see functions such as 'NotifyAllAdmins' where the service pulls all users with an admin type and then calls a notification service to notify them."

> "Orchestration services may have dependencies ranging from

 "foundation services or optional processing services to cross-cutting services such as logging or other utility brokers."

> "What is the purpose of pass-through operations in an orchestration service?

 "Pass-through operations in an orchestration service allow for the propagation of operations such as AddStudentAsync through the service to provide a unified source of interaction with the system at the exposers level. The orchestration service will use the same terminology as the processing or foundation service to propagate the operation."

> "How does the naming convention of an orchestration service reflect its responsibility?

 "The naming convention of an orchestration service reflects its responsibility by focusing on the primary entity and any supporting entities involved in its operations. If the primary entity is a student, then the orchestration service name would be StudentOrchestrationService, and any exceptions created would also reflect this naming convention. This ensures that any orchestration service stays focused on a single entity's responsibility concerning multiple other supporting entities."

> "What range of dependencies can Orchestration services have compared to Processing and Foundation services?

 "Orchestration services may have a wider range of dependencies compared to Processing and Foundation services due to the optionality of Processing services. Therefore, an orchestration service might have dependencies that range from foundation services or optional processing services to cross-cutting services such as logging or other utility brokers."

> "What is the 'Florance Pattern'? Why is it important for orchestration services?

 "The 'Florance Pattern' is a fundamental rule that dictates that any orchestration service may not combine dependencies from different categories of operation. That means an orchestration service cannot combine Foundation and Processing services. The dependencies have to be either all Processing or all Foundation services. The 'Florance Pattern' is important for orchestration services because it ensures consistency and balance in the architecture, which results in improved maintainability, readability, and pluggability."

> "What is the 'Two-Three' rule for orchestration services?

 "The 'Two-Three' rule for orchestration services is a complexity control rule that dictates that an orchestration service may not have more than three or less than two Processing or Foundation services to run the orchestration. This rule, however, doesn't apply to utility brokers. Orchestration services may have a DateTimeBroker or a LoggingBroker without any restriction. But an Orchestration service may not have an entity broker, such as a StorageBroker or a QueueBroker, which feeds directly into the core business layer of any service. The 'Two-Three' rule is inspired by nature, where many creations follow the same pattern of branching into two's and three's, such as trees, thunder, and blood vessels."

 "The 'Florance Pattern' dictates that any orchestration service may not combine dependencies from different categories of operation. An orchestration service cannot combine Foundation and Processing services; the dependencies have to be either all Processings or all Foundation services. However, this rule doesn't apply to utility broker dependencies."

> "What is the 'Two-Three' rule concerning the complexity of Orchestration services?

 "The 'Two-Three' rule is a complexity control rule that states an Orchestration service should not have more than three or less than two Processing or Foundation services to run the orchestration. This rule doesn't apply to utility brokers. However, an Orchestration service may not have an entity broker that feeds directly into the core business layer. This rule is inspired by nature and follows the branching pattern seen in natural creations."

> "What is the purpose of the 'Cul-De-Sac' pattern in normalizing orchestration services?

 "The 'Cul-De-Sac' pattern is used in normalizing orchestration services to add a layer of normalization to the categorical business function. It allows for branching downwards as opposed to upwards, allowing for more focused and specific services. This pattern can help to reduce the complexity of an orchestration service and make it more maintainable and scalable."

> "What is full-normalization in the context of orchestration services?

 "Full-normalization is a mechanism for normalizing orchestration services by finding common ground that equally splits the entities they manage. For instance, if a service has multiple dependencies and a new requirement is added, we can break out the entities in a way that splits the dependencies equally between new and existing services. This way, we can split up the work and reduce the complexity of the orchestration services."

> "Can you provide an example of full-normalization in action?

 "Sure. Let's say we have a StudentContactOrchestrationService with dependencies for Address, Email, and Phone. A new requirement for 'SocialMedia' is added, so we can break out regular contact information versus digital contact information by creating a new StudentDigitalContactOrchestrationService. We modify the existing StudentContactOrchestrationService into StudentRegularContactOrchestrationService and remove its dependency on the EmailService. This way, we split four dependencies into two, each for their orchestration services and reduce the complexity of the orchestration services."

> "The 'Two-Three' rule may require a layer of normalization to the categorical business function.

 "Let's talk about the different mechanisms of normalizing orchestration services."

> "We can go into full-normalization mode simply by finding common ground that equally splits the contact information entities.

 "For instance, we can break out regular contact information versus digital contact information as in 'Address' and 'Phone' versus 'Email' and 'SocialMedia'."

> "What is full-normalization in the context of orchestration services?

 "Full-normalization in the context of orchestration services involves breaking down a large orchestration service into smaller, more specific services that can handle related functionalities. This is done to reduce complexity and improve maintainability and scalability of the overall architecture. By finding common ground that equally splits the entities, we can create new orchestration services and split existing dependencies between them."

> "Can you provide an example of full-normalization in an orchestration service?

 "Suppose we have a StudentContactOrchestrationService with dependencies providing primitive-level functionality for Address, Email, and Phone. If we add a new requirement for SocialMedia, we can split the contact information entities into regular contact information (Address and Phone) and digital contact information (Email and SocialMedia). We can then modify the existing StudentContactOrchestrationService into a StudentRegularContactOrchestrationService with two dependencies and create a new StudentDigitalContactOrchestrationService with two dependencies. An advanced business logic layer, like a coordination service, is then needed to provide student contact information to upstream consumers."

> "What is semi-normalization and when is it required in system architecture?

 "Semi-normalization is a technique used in system architecture when a core entity has to exist before creating or filling in additional information about related entities. It is required when balancing the dependencies of services to honor the 'Two-Three' rule and control complexity. An example of this is when a new service, such as an ImmunizationProcessingService, needs to be added to an existing architecture that already has a StudentRegistrationOrchestrationService with three dependencies. To rebalance the architecture, a semi-normalization is required, which involves combining related entities under the same orchestration service. However, it is important to ensure that each orchestration service has a redundant dependency to ensure no virtual dependencies exist between services, which can threaten the autonomy of the system."

> "What are virtual dependencies in system architecture?

 "Virtual dependencies are hidden connections between two services in a system where one service implicitly assumes that a particular entity will be created and present. They are dangerous because they can threaten the proper autonomy of a service and can make the system diverge from 'The Standard'. Detecting virtual dependencies early in the design and development process is crucial to ensuring a clean and standardized architecture. Adding another dependency to an existing orchestration service may be tempting, but it can lead to an unmaintainable legacy system."

> "What is semi-normalization in the context of orchestration services?

 "Semi-normalization in the context of orchestration services involves re-balancing the architecture to honor the 'Two-Three' rule and control the complexity of the system. This is done when a core entity has to exist before creating or filling in additional information about related entities, requiring a restructuring or extension of the existing architecture. In this scenario, virtual dependencies must be avoided, and early detection of these dependencies may be necessary to ensure a clean and standardized architecture."

> "What is a virtual dependency, and why is it dangerous for an orchestration service architecture?

 "A virtual dependency is a hidden connection between two services of any category, where one service implicitly assumes that a particular entity will be created and present. Virtual dependencies are dangerous because they threaten the proper autonomy of any service, and detecting them early in the design and development process is necessary to ensure a clean and standardized architecture. If left unchecked, virtual dependencies can lead to an unmaintainable legacy system that diverges from 'The Standard' of good design principles and engineering craftsmanship."

> "At this point, a semi-normalization is required for the re-balancing of the architecture to honor the 'Two-Three' rule and eventually to control the complexity.

 "Semi-normalization is a process of restructuring an existing architecture to balance the entities, honor the 'Two-Three' rule and control the complexity."

> "We must think conceptually about the common ground between the primitive entities in a student registration process.

 "In order to complete the student registration process, we must conceptually identify the common ground between the primitive entities."

> "Virtual dependencies are very tricky.

 "Virtual dependencies are complex and can be difficult to detect."

> "It may be very enticing to add another dependency to an existing orchestration service - but that's where the system starts to diverge from 'The Standard'.

 "Adding an additional dependency to an existing orchestration service could divert the system away from 'The Standard', creating an unmaintainable legacy system."

> "What is the 'No-Normalization' approach in the context of service orchestration?

 "The 'No-Normalization' approach in service orchestration is used when higher levels of normalization are challenging to achieve, such as when there are multiple entities that have no connection to each other. In this approach, each primitive service is orchestrated with a core service and then gathered under a coordination service. This approach should only be used as a last resort when all other normalization options have been exhausted."

> "Can you provide an example of when the 'No-Normalization' approach would be necessary?

 "One example where the 'No-Normalization' approach may be necessary is when multiple services, such as AService, BService, and CService, have no connection to each other, but must be orchestrated together under a coordination service. In this scenario, each of the primitive services would be orchestrated with a core service and then gathered under the coordination service, as normalization of any size is impossible due to the lack of relationships between the services."

> "I believe that everything, everywhere, somehow is connected.

 "I believe that all things, everywhere, are somehow connected."

> "So let's assume there are 'AService' and 'BService' orchestrated together with an 'XService'.

 "Let's assume that 'AService' and 'BService' are orchestrated together with an 'XService'."

> "Now, let's say a new service 'CService' is required to be added to the mix to complete the existing flow.

 "Now, a new service 'CService' is needed to complete the existing flow."

> "What is the 'No-Normalization' approach in the context of orchestration services?

 "The 'No-Normalization' approach in the context of orchestration services is employed when it is challenging to achieve higher levels of normalization due to the lack of any relationship between the entities. In this scenario, all the primitive services will be orchestrated with a core service X and then brought together under a coordination service. This approach is usually the last option when normalization of any size is impossible, and it is a rare occurrence in practical scenarios."

> "Why is the 'No-Normalization' approach considered the last option in orchestration service architecture?

 "The 'No-Normalization' approach is considered the last option in orchestration service architecture because it implies that there is no relationship between the entities, making it impossible to achieve any level of normalization. This approach should only be adopted when all other options have been exhausted, as it can lead to a lack of standardization, poor maintainability, and a rigid architecture that is difficult to modify over time."

> "What is the importance of meaningful breakdown in orchestration services?

 "Meaningful breakdown is crucial in orchestration services because it ensures that the grouped services represent a common meaning. Services must be grouped together based on a functional commonality, and the intersection between two or more entities per operation is necessary to have an effective orchestration service. An orchestration service may also have 'Pass-Through' operations that propagate certain routines from their processing or foundation origins if they match the same contract. These routines must have the same contract as the other routines in any orchestration service, as per the 'Pure Contract' principle."

> "Can you provide an example of an orchestration service with 'Pass-Through' operations?

 "One example of an orchestration service with 'Pass-Through' operations is the StudentOrchestrationService. It has an orchestration routine that combines adding a student and creating a library card for that student. It also offers a 'Pass-Through' function for a low-level processing service routine to modify a student. Both of these routines have the same contract as input and output or primitive types, which follows the 'Pure Contract' principle."

> "Putting together a 'StudentProcessingService' and 'LibraryProcessingService' must require a functional commonality.

 "When combining a 'StudentProcessingService' and 'LibraryProcessingService', there must be a functional commonality."

> "Implementing orchestration services without intersection between two or three entities per operation defeats the whole purpose of having an orchestration service.

 "Implementing orchestration services without intersection between two or three entities per operation would not serve its purpose."

> "'Pass-Through' routines must have the same contract as the other routines in any orchestration service.

 "Any 'Pass-Through' routine must have the same contract as the other routines within an orchestration service."

> "Our 'Pure Contract' principle dictates that any service should allow the same contract as input and output or primitive types.

 "The 'Pure Contract' principle states that all services must have the same contract for input, output and primitive types."

> "What is the importance of ensuring that the grouped services in an orchestration service represent a common purpose?","completion": "Ensuring that the grouped services in an orchestration service represent a common purpose is crucial because it helps to maintain standardization, modularity, and better readability of the code. The commonality between the services makes it easier to understand the functionality of the orchestration service and ensure that it aligns with the business requirements. Without a common purpose, the orchestration service would be difficult to implement, modify or maintain over time."

> "What are 'Pass-Through' functions, and how do they work in the context of an orchestration service?

 "In the context of an orchestration service, 'Pass-Through' functions are routines that propagate certain processing or foundational operations that match the same contract as the other routines in the service. These functions allow more flexibility in the architecture, allowing the integration of low-level processing services in the orchestration service without affecting its standardization. Pass-through functions work by providing the same contract as input and output, adhering to the 'Pure Contract' principle, thus maintaining the consistency and modularity of the service."

> "What are the two scenarios for contract/models for orchestration services?

 "There are two scenarios for contract/models for orchestration services: One that stays true to the primary entity's purpose; and one that is complex - a combinator orchestration service that tries to expose its inner target entities explicitly."

> "What is a physical contract in the context of orchestration services?

 "A physical contract in the context of orchestration services refers to a scenario where an orchestration service still exposes functionality that honors the primary entity's physical model and internally communicates with several services that may provide completely different models. These are the scenarios where a single entity has a primary purpose, and all other services are supporting services to ensure a successful flow for that entity."

> "Some orchestration services are still single-purposed even though they may combine two or three other higher-order routines from multiple entities.

 "Despite combining two or three other higher-order routines from multiple entities, some orchestration services remain single-purposed."

> "In our example, the orchestration services _listen_ to a queue for new student messages, then use that event to persist any incoming new students in the system.

 "In the example, the orchestration services listen to a queue for new student messages and use the event to persist any incoming new students."

> "But there are other scenarios where a single entity is not the only purpose/target for an orchestration service.

 "However, there are other scenarios where a single entity is not the only purpose of an orchestration service."

> "Let's talk about that in detail.

 "Let's discuss this in more detail."

> "What are the two scenarios for contracts/models for orchestration services?

 "There are two scenarios for contracts/models for orchestration services. The first is physical contracts, in which an orchestration service is still single-purposed and adheres to the primary entity's purpose, even though it may combine two or three routines from multiple entities. The second scenario is complex, a combinator orchestration service that tries to expose its inner target entities explicitly."

> "Can you explain the physical contracts scenario of an orchestration services with an example?

 "In the physical contracts scenario, an orchestration service adheres to the primary entity's purpose, and all other services are supporting services to ensure a successful flow for that entity. For instance, an orchestration service that reacts to messages from some queue then persists these messages are single-purposed and single-entity orchestration services. The orchestration service still uses the same language as a model to communicate with upper stream services/exposers, like the StudentOrchestrationService in the code snippet that listens to a queue for new student messages and persists the incoming new students in the system."

> "What are virtual contracts in orchestration services?

 "Virtual contracts in orchestration services refer to non-physical contracts that an orchestration service may create to complete a particular operation. These contracts may be a combination of one or many physical (or nested virtual) contracts, or simply have their own flat design in terms of properties. Virtual contracts may also contain additional details used for validation and verification with downstream processing or foundation services. Orchestration services deconstruct incoming virtual models/contracts into physical models that can be processed and persisted using separate processing services."

> "Can physical models contain nested models in orchestration services?

 "Physical models should be anemic and flat in orchestration services, meaning they should contain no routines or constructors and no nested models. However, virtual models can contain nested physical models or other virtual models. This allows orchestration services to create more complex contracts that can be deconstructed into separate physical models for processing and persistence. By keeping physical models flat and anemic, orchestration services can control complexity and focus responsibility."

> "What is an example of using virtual contracts in an orchestration service?

 "An example of using virtual contracts in an orchestration service is when an orchestration service is required to persist a social media post containing a picture. The virtual contract, in this case, may combine the actual post (including the post ID, content, and date) with a list of images attached to the post. The orchestration service can then deconstruct the virtual contract into separate physical models for processing and persistence, with each physical model being handled by a separate processing service. This approach allows for more complex contracts to be handled by the orchestration service while maintaining flat and anemic physical models."

> "In some scenarios, an orchestration service may be required to create non-physical contracts to complete a particular operation.

 "In order to do this, the orchestration service will need to be able to deconstruct the incoming virtual model into the necessary physical models and then use separate processing services to persist them."

> "The incoming model might be significantly different from the actual physical models.

 "In order to make sure that the incoming model is compatible with the physical models, the orchestration service will need to map the virtual model to the physical models and then call the separate processing services to persist them."

> "Consider having this model:

 "The model defines the structure of a MediaPost, which contains the content and a list of base64 images associated with it."

> "What are virtual contracts in the context of orchestration services?

 "In some scenarios, an orchestration service may be required to create non-physical contracts, which are called virtual contracts, to complete a particular operation. These contracts may be significantly different from the actual physical models and can be a combination of one or many physical (or nested virtual) contracts or have their own flat design in terms of properties."

> "Can you explain how an orchestration service would react to an incoming virtual model that combines two different physical entities using an example?

 "If an orchestration service receives an incoming virtual model that combines two different physical entities, it may deconstruct the virtual model into two physical models, each with its separate processing service that handles its persistence. For example, an orchestration service required to persist a social media post containing a picture may map the virtual model MediaPost to physical models Post and Media as shown in the code snippet. The orchestration service then uses each service to persist the corresponding physical models in different database tables."

> "What is the Cul-De-Sac pattern in microservices architecture?

 "The Cul-De-Sac pattern is a characteristic in microservices architecture where an incoming message will turn and head in a different direction for a different dependency. This pattern is typical in large enterprise-level applications where eventual consistency is incorporated to ensure the system can scale and become resilient under heavy consumption. It also prevents malicious attacks against API endpoints since it allows processing queue messages or events whenever the service is ready to process them."

> "Give an example of the Cul-De-Sac pattern in microservices architecture.

 "One example of the Cul-De-Sac pattern in microservices architecture is a simple application where an orchestration service listens to messages for new students coming in and immediately converts that into models that can be persisted in the database. The orchestration service subscribes to the events that would come from the StudentEventService. When an event occurs, the orchestration service will call the ProcessingIncomingStudentMessageAsync function to persist the incoming student into the database through a foundation or a processing service at the same level as the event service."

> "Sometimes, Orchestration services and their equivalent (coordination, management, etc.) may not need an exposer component (controller, for instance).

 "In this case, the input for these services isn't necessarily through an exposer component anymore, as the orchestration service can listen to messages coming in from a subscription to an event service or a queue."

> "The test here indicates an event listening has to occur first, then persistence logic in the student service must match the outcome of mapping an incoming message to a given student.

 "The profileEventOrchestrationService will listen to events for new students coming in, and then convert and persist that into models that can be stored in the database."

> "This pattern or characteristic is called the Cul-De-Sac.

 "This pattern is when an incoming message will turn and head in a different direction for a different dependency, and is typical in large enterprise-level applications where eventual consistency is incorporated."

> "What are the responsibilities of orchestration services?

 "Orchestration services provide advanced business logic, integrating multiple routines from multiple entities to complete a single flow. They ensure the correct routines for each entity are integrated and called in the correct order. Additionally, they are responsible for rolling back a failing operation."

> "Can you give an example of how orchestration services combine multiple routines from different entities?

 "For example, during the student registration process, an orchestration service would need to integrate routines from both the Student and LibraryCard models. While adding a student record is required to register a student, assigning a library card to that student is also necessary for a successful registration process. The orchestration service would ensure that the correct routines for each model are called in the correct order to complete the registration process."

> "Orchestration services provide advanced business logic.

 "Orchestration services combine multiple routines from multiple entities in order to complete a single flow, and ensure the correct routines for each entity are integrated, as well as called in the correct order."

> "Adding a student record is required to register a student, but assigning a library card to that student is required for a successful student registration process.

 "An orchestration service will make sure that both of these routines are properly completed in order for the student to be successfully registered."

> "Orchestration services are responsible for rolling back a failing operation.

 "In the case of a failed operation, the orchestration service should be able to roll back changes made to any related entities and undo any changes that have been made."

> "What are the responsibilities of an orchestration service?

 "Orchestration services provide advanced business logic, combining multiple routines from multiple entities to complete a single flow. This involves ensuring the correct routines for each entity are integrated and called in the correct order, as well as rolling back a failing operation if necessary."

> "Can orchestration services handle different entities/models with different purposes?

 "Yes, orchestration services can handle different entities/models with different purposes as long as they share a common flow or purpose. For example, a LibraryCard model and a Student model may be fundamentally different, but both are required for a successful student registration process. Orchestration services ensure the correct routines for each entity are integrated and called in the correct order to complete the registration process."

> "What are flow combinations in orchestration services?

 "Flow combinations in orchestration services involve combining multiple routines from multiple entities to achieve a common purpose or a single flow. This process involves ensuring the purity of the exposed input and output contracts and mapping incoming contracts to their respective downstream services. Orchestration services are also responsible for mapping back the returned results from these services into the unified model. The mapping and branching don't just happen on the way in, but a reverse action has to be taken on the way out as well. Breaking out the mapping logic into its own aspect/partial class file is also recommended."

> "What is the responsibility of orchestration services during flow combination?

 "During flow combination, orchestration services are responsible for ensuring the correct routines for each entity are integrated and called in the correct order. They are also responsible for rolling back a failing operation. Additionally, orchestration services are responsible for ensuring the purity of the exposed input and output contracts and mapping incoming contracts to their respective downstream services. They will also map back the returned results from these services into the unified model. Breaking out the mapping logic into its own aspect/partial class file is also recommended."

> "What is meant by flow combinations in orchestration services?

 "Flow combinations in orchestration services involve combining multiple routines from multiple entities to achieve a common purpose or a single flow. Orchestration services are responsible for ensuring that the correct routines for each entity are integrated and called in the correct order, as well as mapping incoming contracts to downstream services and back again, to ensure the purity of the input and output contracts."

> "Why is it important to map the outgoing results back to the unified input model in orchestration services?

 "Mapping the outgoing results back to the unified input model in orchestration services is important to ensure that any unexpected changes to the incoming request during persistence are detected. It is a violation of The Standard to return the same input object that was passed in, as this takes away any visibility on potential changes to the incoming request. A duplex mapping should substitute the need to dereference the incoming request and ensure no unexpected internal changes have occurred."

> "What is the natural order in an orchestration process and how does it relate to input parameters?

 "The natural order in an orchestration process refers to specific flows that cannot be executed unless a prerequisite of input parameters is retrieved or persisted. For instance, in a situation where a library card cannot be created unless a student's unique identifier is retrieved first, we don't have to worry about testing that certain routines were called in the right order because it comes naturally with the flow. In this case, having a student's unique identifier is a requirement for creating a library card, so the orchestration of order here comes naturally as part of the flow without additional effort."

> "What is the difference between natural order and enforced order in an orchestration process?

 "The difference between natural order and enforced order in an orchestration process is that natural order refers to specific flows that cannot be executed unless a prerequisite of input parameters is retrieved or persisted, while enforced order involves explicitly enforcing a specific order of routines to be executed. For example, natural order occurs when a library card cannot be created unless a student's unique identifier is retrieved first, while enforced order might involve creating a student record before creating a library card."

> "Why is calling routines in the correct order important in orchestration services?

 "Calling routines in the correct order is important in orchestration services because certain flows require that a prerequisite of input parameters is retrieved or persisted before other routines can be executed. Failure to follow the correct order can lead to errors or incorrect output. There are two types of order to consider - natural order and enforced order."

> "What is natural order in orchestration services?

 "Natural order in orchestration services refers to specific flows where the correct order comes naturally with the flow, as a prerequisite of input parameters is retrieved or persisted before other routines can be executed. For example, creating a library card might require retrieving a student's unique identifier first, which comes naturally as part of the flow."

> "What is the difference between natural order and enforced order when it comes to calling routines?

 "Natural order refers to specific flows that cannot be executed unless a prerequisite of input parameters is retrieved or persisted, whereas enforced order refers to the type of order that must be implemented through unit tests because there is no dependency between the return value of one routine and the input parameters of the next."

> "When is an enforced type of order required in orchestration services?

 "It's more likely that the type of ordering leans more towards enforced than natural when orchestration services reach the maximum number of dependencies, and there is no dependency between the return value of one routine and the input parameters of the next."

> "What is enforced order in orchestration services?

 "Enforced order in orchestration services refers to situations where there is no natural dependency between the return value of one routine and the input parameters of the next. In such cases, an enforced type of order must be implemented through unit tests to ensure that non-naturally connected dependencies are sequentially called in the intended order. This is important to prevent errors or incorrect output. Mock frameworks are often used to enforce the order of dependencies within a method."

> "What is the difference between natural and enforced order in orchestration services?

 "Natural order in orchestration services refers to specific flows that naturally enforce a certain order of routines based on prerequisites of input parameters. Enforced order, on the other hand, is necessary when there is no natural dependency between the return value of one routine and the input parameters of the next. Enforced order requires implementing a specific order of dependencies through unit tests to ensure correct output and prevent errors."

> "What is Exceptions Mapping in the context of service-oriented architecture?"
 "Exceptions Mapping is the responsibility of orchestration services in service-oriented architecture to unify all the exceptions that may occur out of any of its dependencies into one unified categorical exception model. This mapping helps upstream consumers of the orchestration service to determine the next course of action based on one categorical exception type instead of multiple categorical exceptions. The mapping involves wrapping the localized exceptions from downstream services with categorical exceptions at the current service layer to ensure consistency with the Exposers layer. These exceptions can be easily handled and mapped into whatever the nature of the exposer component dictates. The same rule applies to dependency exceptions, which can be both Service and Dependency exceptions from downstream services."

> "Why is it important to unwrap and wrap localized exceptions from downstream services with categorical exceptions?"
 "It is important to unwrap and wrap localized exceptions from downstream services with categorical exceptions at the current service layer to ensure consistency with the Exposers layer. These exceptions can be easily handled and mapped into whatever the nature of the exposer component dictates. In the case of an Exposer component of type API Controller, the mapping would produce HTTP Status Codes. In the case of UI Exposer components, it would map to text meaningful to end users. This mapping helps to reduce the number of categorical exceptions and makes it easier for upstream consumers of the orchestration service to determine the next course of action based on one categorical exception type instead of multiple categorical exceptions. The same rule applies to dependency exceptions, which can be both Service and Dependency exceptions from downstream services."

> "What are the different variations of orchestration services?

 "Orchestration services can vary depending on their position in the overall low-level architecture.

> "What is the cul-de-sac pattern in orchestration services?

 "The cul-de-sac pattern in orchestration services refers to a pattern where each event notifies its orchestration services in a one-way pattern.

> "What is the difference between the single-threaded approach and the eventing approach in orchestration services?

 "The single-threaded approach in orchestration services is a working solution for a specific request, while the eventing approach breaks down dependencies into events that notify their orchestration services in a cul-de-sac pattern. The eventing approach simplifies the flow and lowers the risk of failures in downstream services. However, it does not guarantee an immediate response of success or failure to the requestor since it is an eventual-consistency pattern."

> "Every request can do one thing and one thing only, including its prerequisites.

 "For instance, if you need to register a student in a school, You may also require adding a guardian, contact information, and other details."

> "What is the unit of work concept?

 "The unit of work concept means that every request can do one thing and one thing only, including its prerequisites. For example, to register a student in a school, various actions need to be taken, such as adding a guardian, contact information, and other details. These dependencies can be broken down into events, allowing other services to pick up where the single-threaded services leave off to continue the registration process."

> "What are the benefits of using eventing in orchestration services?

 "Using eventing in orchestration services helps to decrease the complexity of the flow and lower the risk of failures in downstream services. It allows the incoming request to be turned into events, where each event would notify its orchestration services in a cul-de-sac pattern. This approach simplifies the process and means that a single thread is no longer responsible for the success of each dependency in the system. Additionally, the use of eventual consistency in this approach can add an extra layer of resiliency to events."

> "What is the eventual consistency approach, and how does it work?

 "The eventual consistency approach is a pattern where the client would get an Accepted message or its equivalent based on the communication protocol to let them know that a process has started. The process may not be immediate and could take some time to execute as it involves handling events that notify the orchestrator services. However, there's no guarantee of results until all event logic has been executed. This approach is suitable for non-critical situations, but clients would not receive an immediate response."

These levels include basic progress, visual progress with no indication of details, and detailed progress with exact percentage completion and a best guess of the time remaining."

> "What is the most important principle in building UI components according to the Standard?

 "The most important principle in building UI components is to develop intelligence to keep the user engaged while a particular process is running, such as a simple spinner or a progress bar to keep users informed at all times of what's happening behind the scenes."

> "What is the basic progress approach in indicating progress?

 "The basic progress approach is where you present a status with a label like 'Waiting...' or a spinner with no further indication, which is the bare minimum of progress indication."

> "What is the highest level of reporting progress in UI components?

 "The highest level of reporting progress is the detailed progress type, where the UI component is fully transparent with its consumers by reporting every step of progress. This type of progress is more common in scientific applications."

> "What factors determine the type of progress indicator to use in a UI?

 "Selecting the correct type of progress indicator in a UI depends on the business flow, the type of users interacting with the system, and several other variables we will discuss in The Experience Standard."

> "What is the remaining progress approach?

 "The remaining progress approach is an indication of remaining time or progress to be completed before the request is processed, such as '40% remaining' or '5 minutes remaining...'."

> "What is the detailed progress approach?

 "The detailed progress approach is the highest level of reporting progress, where the UI component is fully transparent with its consumers by reporting every step of progress."

> "What is remaining progress in UI components?

 "Remaining progress in UI components is an indication of the amount of progress that still needs to be completed before a request is fully processed. This can be communicated to users through indicators like 'x% remaining' or 'x amount of time remaining' to help them understand how long a process will take to complete."

> "What is detailed progress in UI components?

 "Detailed progress is the highest level of reporting progress in UI components, where the UI is fully transparent with its consumers by reporting every step of progress. This is more common in scientific applications or when debugging and can help end-users understand what is happening behind the scenes, but it may not always be preferred in terms of user experience and security concerns may require some details to be hidden."

> "What is the simple indication of success in UI exposer components?

 "The simple indication of success in UI exposer components is when the UI reports that the process was completed without further details, such as 'Thank you, request submitted' or a checkmark with a green color that indicates success."

> "What is the purpose of partial details in UI exposer components?

 "The purpose of partial details in UI exposer components is to provide the end-user with a 'ticket number' or overview of the nature of the request and its status, especially for larger requests that contain confidential information or multiple parts. This helps end-users follow up on their requests later and allows customer support personnel to assess the requests more effectively."

> "What is the simple indication of success?

 "The simple indication of success is when the UI reports that the process was completed without further details, such as 'Thank you, request submitted' or a checkmark with a visualization of green color that indicates success."

> "What is the partial details approach?

 "The partial details approach is an overview of the nature of the request and where it stands in terms of status and timestamps, such as providing the end-user with a 'ticket number' to help them follow up on their requests later."

> "What are the different types of results visualization in UI components?

 "There are two types of results visualization in UI components: simple and partial details. Simple indication of success is when the UI reports that the process was completed without further details, while partial details provide end-users with an overview of the nature of the request and its status, such as a tracking number in e-commerce applications. Partial details can be helpful for larger requests containing multiple parts and confidential information."

> "When would partial details be useful in UI components?

 "Partial details in UI components can be useful for providing end-users with a tracking number or an overview of the status of their request. This is particularly helpful for larger requests that contain multiple parts and confidential information, such as an application to join a university or an e-commerce purchase that includes payment details."

> "What is the purpose of simple results indication?

 "The purpose of simple results indication is to report that a process has been completed successfully without further details. This can be done through messages such as 'Thank you, request submitted' or a checkmark with a green color visualization."

> "What is the advantage of providing partial details in results indication?

 "Providing partial details in results indication, such as a 'ticket number' to track the status of the request, can be helpful for end-users to follow up on their requests later. This is often seen in e-commerce applications where customers are provided with tracking numbers for their purchases."

> "When would you prefer to report full details in results indication?

 "Full details may be preferred in results indication for smaller requests to help end-users review their requests. It could also include a status update from the server along with an assigned point of contact or officer from maintenance and support teams. However, it may not be necessary for larger requests that contain confidential information."

> "What is the primary responsibility of error reports?

 "The primary responsibility of error reports is to inform end-users of what happened, why it happened, and the next course of action. Even the bare minimum of error reports, which is the informational type, should indicate that an error occurred and why it happened. This can be done through messages such as 'Request failed. Try again' or 'Our servers are currently experiencing a high volume of requests. Please try again later'."

> "Why is it important to shift the technical language of errors to a less technical language in some systems?

 "It is important to shift the technical language of errors to a less technical language in some systems to make it more readable and understandable for the end-users. For instance, instead of saying 'Student Id cannot be null, empty or widespace', a more readable language such as 'Please provide a valid student Id' should be used. However, the level of technicality used in error reports depends on the context and type of users receiving them. In scientific applications, for example, more details may be necessary."

> "What is the bare minimum of error reports?

 "The bare minimum of error reports is the informational type, which is indicating an error occurred and why it happened, such as 'Request failed. Try again' or 'Request failed, contact support'."

> "What should be done in a scientific application when it comes to error reports?

 "In a scientific application, the more details the better when it comes to error reports."

> "What is the purpose of full details in error reports?

 "Full details may be included in error reports to provide end-users with more information about the error, including details about the request, status updates from the server, and contacts from maintenance and support teams. This can be particularly useful for smaller requests where it may help the end-users review their requests or as an extra confirmation step before submitting the request."

> "What is the bare minimum in error reporting?

 "The bare minimum in error reporting is the informational type, which indicates that an error occurred and why it happened. This type of error report provides essential details about the error and keeps the end-user engaged with the system. It may also include time-based information, such as when the server is experiencing a high volume of requests and the end-user should try again later. It is important to use language that is readable and less technical, depending on the context and the type of users receiving them."

> "What is a referential error report?

 "Referential error reports automatically inform the support team and provide a reference ticket to end-users so they can follow up. They are useful for business flows as they take care of all actions, send an email to the end-user, and follow up within a few days to report the status. The system should require the fewest actions possible from the end-users after a failure has occurred."

> "What is an actionable error report?

 "Actionable error reports provide an additional action for the users to go further in their request, such as a button to try again or submit other details to the engineering and support teams. These reports are more convenient than informational reports, but they still require the end-users to take more actions and keystrokes, which can be inconvenient."

> "What is meant by 'single dependency'?

 "Single dependency means that any exposer component can only integrate with a single dependency at a time. For UI components, contract purity ensures that a UI is not given more data than it needs. A new type of foundational-like service is implemented to enforce this pattern, and all other details, such as audit fields, timestamps, and such, are taken care of away from the UI component sight. View services will be discussed in detail later when discussing UI exposers."

> "What is single dependency for UI components?

 "Single dependency for UI components ensures that a UI is not given more data than it needs and a new type of foundational-like service is implemented to enforce this pattern."

> "What will be discussed in detail shortly?

 "View services will be discussed in detail shortly as we progress talking about UI exposers."

> "What is a referential error report?

 "A referential error report automatically informs the support team and provides a reference of a support ticket to end-users so they can follow up. This type of error report is useful for certain business flows since it takes care of all necessary actions, such as sending an email to the end-user with the reference number, and following up within a couple of days to report the status. The fewer actions required of end-users after a failure has occurred, the better."

> "What is an actionable error report?

 "An actionable error report provides an additional action for end-users to move forward in their request. For example, it might include a button to try again or submit additional details to the engineering and support teams. These error reports are more convenient than informational reports but require end-users to take more actions and keystrokes. However, they can be helpful in hybrid legacy and modernized applications where different routes are available to accomplish the same task."

> "What is the anatomy of UI exposers?

 "UI exposer components can be Bases, Components, or Containers, and each has a specific responsibility to ensure the maximum maintainability and pluggability of the system. Base components are thin wrappers around native or 3rd party components, and their primary responsibility is to abstract away the hard dependency on non-local components. They make it easier to mock out external or native component behavior and focus on ensuring the local component performs as expected."

> "What is the responsibility of Base Components in UI exposers?

 "The primary responsibility of Base Components in UI exposers is to abstract away the hard dependency on non-local components, allowing the system's configuration to switch to any other external or native UI components with the least effort possible.

 "Core components leverage Base components in a web application to perform specific business flows, using Elements, Styles, and Actions to construct the UI and data interactions that make up those flows."

> "What are Elements in Core Components? How can they be tested?

 "Elements are the markup pieces found in a .razor file that make up the skeleton of any Core Component. They should always be of Base Components and may or may not expose sub-routines. Elements can be tested through existence, properties, and actions. To test for existence, we can use property assignment, searching by id, or searching for all types. For example, to test for property assignment, we can define a property for the corresponding Element, such as NameTextBox in a StudentRegistrationComponent, and then write a test to verify that the Element exists at render-time by checking that the property is not null."

> "What is Property Assignment in Element testing?

 "Property Assignment is a way of testing for the existence of an Element in Core Components. It involves defining a property for the corresponding Element and then writing a test to verify that the Element exists at render-time by checking that the property is not null. For example, in a StudentRegistrationComponent, we could define a NameTextBox property of the same type as the Base Component that will be attached to it, and then write a failing test to ensure that this Element exists. Once the markup is added to StudentRegistrationComponent.razor and the test is run again, it should pass."

 "Elements in a web application are the markup pieces found in the .razor file of a component. They are the building blocks of Core Components and should always be of Base Components."

> "What are the three main ways to test the existence of Elements in a web application?

 "The three main ways to test the existence of Elements in a web application are property assignment, searching by ID, and searching for all types. Property assignment involves defining a property corresponding to the Element, while searching by ID and type involve finding the Element using specific identifiers."

> "What is the purpose of the StudentRegistrationComponent in the test example provided?

 "The purpose of the StudentRegistrationComponent in the test example is to demonstrate how to test the existence of an Element by property assignment. The NameTextBox property is defined and then instantiated at render-time, allowing the test to verify its existence."

> "What is the expected outcome of the ShouldLoadNameTextBox test provided in the example?

 "The ShouldLoadNameTextBox test should fail initially since the corresponding markup for the NameTextBox property has not yet been defined. After updating the markup to include the TextBoxBase @ref=NameTextBox element, the test should pass."

> "Why is it important for Elements to be of Base Components?

 "It is important for Elements to be of Base Components in a web application because this helps ensure consistency and simplifies testing. Base Components are more generic in nature and can be reused across multiple Core Components, reducing the amount of duplicated code and increasing maintainability."

> "What are Elements in Razor Components and how can they be tested?

 "Elements in Razor Components are the markup pieces that make up the Core Components. They can be tested through three main ways: Existence, Properties, and Actions. The Existence of an Element can be tested by Property Assignment or Searching by Id. For Property Assignment, every Component should have a corresponding property that gets attached to the Element at runtime. For Searching by Id, sometimes Property Assignment is not an option, so we need to use the component's id as an identifier for every component and search for it dynamically. An example of Searching by Id is loading a list of components dynamically using a list of students and using the student object Id as an identifier for every component. We can find the components that match the student Id and verify their existence. In this case, we use the PrettyBlazor library to markup our iteration behavior with the <Iterations> tag."

> "Can you provide an example of how to test the Existence of an Element using Property Assignment in Razor Components?

 "To test the Existence of an Element using Property Assignment in Razor Components, we first define a property of the same type as the Base Component that will be attached to the Element. We then write a failing test that verifies that this Element exists by checking that the property is not null. For example, assume we have a StudentRegistrationComponent with a TextBoxBase property called NameTextBox. We can write a failing test as follows: this.renderedStudentRegistrationComponent = RenderComponent<StudentRegistrationComponent>(); this.renderedStudentRegistrationComponent.Instance.NameTextBox.Should().NotBeNull(); Once we change the markup in StudentRegistrationComponent.razor to <TextBoxBase @ref=NameTextBox>, the test should pass."

> "Sometimes Property Assignment is not an option. There are scenarios where components load dynamically a set of nested components that we may not have access to them in design-time.

 "In this case, searching by Id is our best option to ensure we have the right component in hand."

> "What is the purpose of searching by ID when testing the existence of Elements in a web application?

 "Searching by ID is used when Property Assignment is not an option, such as when nested components are loaded dynamically and we do not have access to them in design-time. By using an identifier, we can locate the desired component and verify its existence during testing."

> "What is the purpose of the StudentListComponent in the test example provided?

 "The purpose of the StudentListComponent in the test example is to dynamically load a set of nested StudentComponents based on a list of students. By using <Iterations> and the student object Id as an identifier, each StudentComponent is created and attached to the StudentListComponent at runtime."

> "What is the expected outcome of the ShouldLoadStudentsAsync test provided in the example?

 "The ShouldLoadStudentsAsync test should fail initially since the StudentListComponent and nested StudentComponents have not yet been defined in the markup. After updating the markup to include <Iterations> and rendering the StudentListComponent, the test should pass by verifying the existence of each StudentComponent using their corresponding Ids."

> "What is the benefit of using <Iterations> in the example code?

 "Using <Iterations> simplifies the process of dynamically loading nested components by iterating over a list of items and creating a new component for each item. This reduces the amount of duplicated code and increases maintainability by allowing for reuse across multiple components."

> "What is the purpose of General search mechanism?

 "General search mechanism is used when we don't have a key or an 'Id' to find the element, and we rely on the count of rendered components against the count that we expect. This mechanism is particularly useful in scenarios where we expect a list of 'things' to load on the screen without any data or information on them."

> "What is the example code snippet given for General search mechanism?

 "The example code snippet given for General search mechanism is in C# and it verifies that a certain number of elements are loaded on the screen. It generates a random count and then checks that the count of 'p' elements loaded on the screen matches the random count. The test is performed using the Should().Be() method."

> "Why is it advised against having unknown-typed components loaded on the screen?

 "The Standard advises against having unknown-typed components loaded on the screen as they give a lot less control for engineers to know precisely what's going on. This makes it difficult to debug issues and makes the code more error-prone. However, in gaming scenarios where the elements are dynamic and can change frequently, using the General search mechanism may be the only option."

> "What is the General Search mechanism in component testing?

 "The General Search mechanism is a way to find components without an identifier or key by relying on the count of rendered components against the expected count. This approach is used in scenarios where the components have no data or information on them and no specific way to identify them."

> "Why does the Standard advice against having unknown-typed components?

 "The Standard advice against having unknown-typed components is because they give less control for engineers to know precisely what's going on. It's generally better to have a clear understanding of the components being used and how they're constructed to ensure the smooth operation of the application."

> "In what scenarios might General Search be the only option for finding components?

 "General Search might be the only option for finding components in scenarios where we have no control over the types of components being loaded or when dealing with gaming scenarios that involve unknown elements. However, it should be avoided when possible due to the lack of specificity and control."

> "What are properties in the context of Core Components?

 "Properties in the context of Core Components refer to the information or values that are set on the Core or Base Component. These properties could be set on the component itself or on its child components, and they are used to verify that the correct values are being displayed on the screen."

> "What is an example of using properties to test a Core Component?

 "In the example given, a failing test is set up to verify that a LabelBase component has the correct default value. The test assigns an expected value to the FirstNameLabel property on the StudentRegistrationComponent and then checks that the rendered component's FirstNameLabel property has the same value. By setting the Value property of the LabelBase component to 'First Name', the test passes."

> "How are view models used in conjunction with Core Components?

 "View models can be loaded on initialization and then assigned to certain Base Components. This allows the view models to be displayed on the screen and interacted with by the user. By assigning the view models to Base Components, it becomes possible to verify that the correct information is being displayed on the screen. For example, a view model that contains a list of items can be assigned to a ListBoxBase component, and then the values of the items in the list can be verified using the properties of the ListBoxBase component."

> "What are the properties that we consider when developing Core Components?

 "When developing Core Components, we consider properties on the Core Component itself or the Base Component. These properties can be used to verify specific information or values on a component, such as the text on a label or the view model being used."

> "What is an example of a failing test for verifying property values on a label?

 "A failing test for verifying property values on a label could involve setting an expected value for the label and then checking that the label's value property matches it. If it doesn't match, the test will fail and indicate that the property value is incorrect."

> "How can we use properties in Core Components to verify certain information or values?

 "We can use properties in Core Components, such as view models or specific text values, to verify certain information or values on a component. By setting up a test that checks for the expected property value and then looking for that value in the component's code, we can ensure that the component is working correctly and displaying the right information."

> "What is the importance of testing actions in web components?

 "Testing actions is important because it ensures that the expected behavior is triggered when a user interacts with a component. For example, when a button is clicked, a certain action should be triggered, like changing a property or creating a new element. Testing actions helps to verify that the component is functioning as intended and that user interactions are handled correctly."

> "Can you provide an example of testing an action in a web component?

 "One example of testing an action in a web component is verifying that a button click triggers a certain action, such as calling a service to register a new student. In this case, we would create a failing test that checks if the expected action was triggered, then implement the behavior in the component code by attaching a function to the button's OnClick event. Once the behavior is implemented, we can run the test again to verify that the action is now being triggered as expected."

> "Why is testing actions important when developing Core Components?

 "Testing actions is important when developing Core Components because we want to ensure that certain actions are triggered when a user interacts with the component, such as clicking a button or entering text into a field. By testing these actions, we can ensure that the component is working correctly and performing the desired behavior."

> "What is an example of a failing test for an action in a Core Component?

 "A failing test for an action in a Core Component could involve setting up an expected action to occur when an element is interacted with, such as clicking a button, and then verifying that the action was not triggered. If the test fails, it means that the action was not performed correctly and that the component is not working as expected."

> "How do we implement actions in Core Components?

 "To implement actions in Core Components, we need to create a function or routine that performs the desired action, such as adding a new record to a database or changing a property value. We then attach that function to the appropriate UI Element on the markup side, such as a button or text field, and verify that the action is triggered correctly in our unit tests."

> "What are Core Components in UI design and why are styles important in them?

 "Core Components in UI design are elements that carry certain styles to ensure the user experience is fitting the type of business they're trying to accomplish. While Base Components can also carry their own styles, it's important to realize that styles are better fit into Core Components to ensure the modularity of Base Components to fit whatever style is enforced by Core Components. Testing styles on Core Components is not very common in the UI world, but it is important for a standardized way of testing styles for UI components."

> "What is SharpStyles library and how is it used for testing styles in C# code?

 "SharpStyles is a library that is used to test styles in C# code. It translates C# code into CSS styles flawlessly. To use SharpStyles for testing styles, one needs to create a C# model with the identifiers they would like to have in their CSS style. This model will get translated into a CSS class later when the component is rendered. Then, one can utilize this model in their component by creating a new property for styles and hooking it to a markup that will transform these styles/models into pure native CSS. This requires the creation of a StyleBase Element/Base Component to take care of the abstraction side, so there are no hard dependencies on the SharpStyle library."

> "How do you write a failing test for requiring a button to have a blue background color?

 "To write a failing test for requiring a button to have a blue background color, one needs to define the expected CSS class and style object with the BackgroundColor property set to blue. Then, they need to render the component and assert that the CssClass, StudentRegistrationStyle, and Style properties of the StyleBase and StudentRegistrationComponent match the expected values."

> "Core Components also carries more than just elements.

 "Core Components also carry certain styles to ensure the user-experience is fitting the type of business they're trying to accomplish."

> "Testing styles isn't a very common thing in the UI world.

 "Especially when it comes to test-driving styles in C# as code."

> "What is the importance of testing styles in Core Components?

 "Testing styles in Core Components is important because it ensures that the user interface is consistent and fits the desired design aesthetic. By testing styles, we can verify that the styles are being applied correctly and that the user experience is not negatively impacted by any style changes or updates."

> "What is SharpStyles and how is it used for testing styles in Core Components?

 "SharpStyles is a library that allows for the translation of C# code into CSS styles. It is used to test styles in Core Components by allowing developers to define styles using C# models, which can then be rendered into CSS styles and applied to the markup. This ensures consistency and helps to minimize the learning curve for engineers working on the project."

> "What is the purpose of the StyleBase Element/Base Component in testing styles for Core Components?

 "The StyleBase Element/Base Component is used to abstract the application of CSS styles in a way that does not create a hard dependency on any specific library or framework. By using this abstraction layer, it is possible to apply CSS styles in a consistent and modular way, which helps to ensure flexibility and modularity in Core Components."

> "What are actions in Core Components?

 "Actions in Core Components are similar to actions in Base Components or Elements, and can be verified by changing a property or style, creating other components, or triggering other actions. Verifiability is key."

> "Can you give an example of an action in Core Components?

 "An example of an action in Core Components could be a submit button that disables existing elements and triggers a call or action to another service. It should be verifiable through various means, as discussed above."

> "Actions in Core Components are very similar to Actions in Base Components or Elements.

 "It is important however to understand that every Action can easily be verified by either changing a property or style, creating other components or simply triggering other actions."

> "It can also be a combination of one or many of the aforementioned.

 "For instance, a submit button could change the properties on existing elements by making them disabled while triggering a call/action to another service."

> "What is the significance of Actions in Core Components?

 "Actions in Core Components are used to trigger certain events or behaviors within the user interface. These can be verified by changing properties or styles, creating other components or triggering other actions. By verifying Actions, it is possible to ensure that the user experience is consistent and that the desired behaviors are being executed correctly."

> "How can Actions in Core Components be verified?

 "Actions in Core Components can be verified by changing properties or styles, creating other components, or triggering other actions. By verifying these actions, it is possible to ensure that the desired behavior is executed correctly and that the user experience remains consistent."

> "Explain the implementation of the core component in the given code example.

 "The code example shows the implementation of a core component called StudentRegistrationComponent. It has several properties, including StudentViewService, State, StudentView, StudentNameTextBox, SubmitButton, and StatusLabel. The StudentViewService maps raw API models/data into consumable UI models. The State determines whether a component should be Loading, Content, or Error. The StudentView binds incoming input to one unified model. The StudentNameTextBox, SubmitButton, and StatusLabel are Base level components used to construct the form of registration. The markup code binds these components to the properties of the StudentRegistrationComponent instance to ensure rendering and data submission execution. There are also two tests that validate the rendering of the components and the submission of data. The first test verifies that all components are assigned a reference property, and no external dependency calls have been made. The second test validates that on submission, the student model is populated with the data set programmatically through the base component instance, and all these components are rendered on the screen before end-users by validating each base component's assigned instance on runtime or render-time."

> "What does the first test in the code example verify?

 "The first test in the code example verifies that all the components are assigned a reference property, and no external dependency calls have been made. It validates that the code in the OnIntialized function on the component level is validated and performing as expected."

> "What does the second test in the code example validate?

 "The second test in the code example validates that on submittal, the student model is populated with the data set programmatically through the base component instance, and all these components are rendered on the screen before end-users by validating each base component's assigned instance on runtime or render-time."

> "The dependency view service maps raw API models/data into consumable UI models.

 "And the `State` determines whether a component should be `Loading`, `Content` or `Error`."

> "The data view model binds incoming input to one unified model, `StudentView`.

 "And the last three are Base level components used to construct the form of registration."

> "What are the restrictions for Core components?

 "Core components have similar restrictions to Base components because they cannot call each other at that level. They are also not allowed to call more than one view service. Additionally, they don't render anything on their own, but instead are combined by Orchestration Core Components to exchange messages."

> "What is the role of a View service in the architecture?

 "A View service corresponds to one core component and renders one view model. They may do their own orchestration-level work, but it is recommended to keep things at a flat level. View services primarily perform mapping, adding audit fields, and basic structural validations."

> "Core components have similar restrictions to Base components because they cannot call each other at that level.

 "There's a level of Orchestration Core Components that can combine multiple components to exchange messages but they don't render anything on their own the same way Orchestration services delegate all the work to their dependencies."

> "One view service corresponds to one core component, which renders one and only one view model.

 "But Core components are also not allowed to call more than one view service."

> "What are the different types of properties within any given component?

 "The different types of properties within any given component includes the dependency view service, which maps raw API models/data into consumable UI models, the State, which determines whether a component should be Loading, Content or Error, the data view model which binds incoming input to one unified model, and the last three are Base level components used to construct the form of registration."

> "What are some ways to test if a component is working as expected?

 "Through unit tests, it is possible to ensure that the component is working as expected and meets the desired specifications. This is important as any issues can be caught in the development stages and resolved immediately. Examples of tests include verifying component properties are assigned a reference and no external dependency calls have been made, checking whether the SubmitStudentAsync() method is working as expected, and verifying that the correct external dependency calls are being made."

> "What are the restrictions on Core components?

 "Core components have similar restrictions to Base components and cannot call each other at that level. They are also not allowed to call more than one view service, and correspond to rendering one and only one view model. While view services may perform their own orchestration-level work, it is recommended to keep things at a flat level to maintain simplicity. Additionally, each view service may perform mapping and adding audit fields in addition to basic structural validations."

> "What is the role of pages in a web application?

 "Pages are a mandatory container component in a web application that allows end-users to navigate to them. Pages mainly hold a route, communicate a parameter from that route, and combine core-level components to represent a business value. They delegate all route-related operations to their child components and do not hold any business logic in themselves."

> "What is the unobtrusiveness rule for UI components?

 "The unobtrusiveness rule states that it is a violation to include code from multiple technologies/languages on the same page for all UI components. CSS style code, C# code, and HTML markup should be separated into their own files. Every component can nest its files beneath it, with the .razor file containing all the markup needed to initialize the component and nested files supporting simple UI logic code and styling."

> "What is the purpose of pages in web applications?

 "The purpose of pages in web applications is to provide a fundamental mandatory container component that end-users can navigate to, and to hold a route, communicate a parameter from that route, and combine core-level components to represent a business value."

> "What is an example of a page?

 "An example of a page is a dashboard page which contains multiple components like tiles, notifications, headers, and sidebars with references to other pages."

> "What is the unobtrusiveness rule?

 "The unobtrusiveness rule is a rule in which it is a violation to include code from multiple technologies/languages on the same page and must be separated into their own files in order to prevent cognitive pollution for engineers building UI components and make the system much easier to maintain."

> "What is the purpose of pages in a web application?

 "Pages are a fundamental mandatory container component in every web application that allows end-users to navigate to specific routes. The main function of pages is to hold a functional route, communicate parameters from that route, and combine core-level components to represent a business value. An example of a page implementation is a dashboard, which contains multiple components like tiles, notifications, headers, and sidebars with references to other pages."

> "What is the unobtrusiveness rule in UI component development?

 "The unobtrusiveness rule states that it's a violation to include code from multiple technologies/languages on the same page. To maintain simplicity and prevent cognitive pollution when building UI components, CSS style code, C# code, and HTML markup should be separated into their own files. UI components can nest their files beneath them if the development environment allows for partial implementation, with the .razor file containing the markup and the nested files containing support for simple UI logic code and styling."

> "What is the organization structure for UI components in the solution?

 "All UI components are listed under a Views folder in the solution, which contains subfolders for Bases, Components, and Pages. This tri-nature conforming organization should make it easier to shift reusable components and find components based on their categories."

> "Why is unobtrusiveness important for UI component development?

 "Unobtrusiveness helps prevent cognitive pollution for engineers building UI components and makes the system easier to maintain. It requires that code from multiple technologies/languages (such as CSS, C#, and HTML) not exist in the same file, and that each component nest its files beneath it (such as .razor, .razor.cs, and .razor.css files for a Blazor component) to separate markup, UI logic code, and styling."

> "What is the organization of UI components?

 "The organization of UI components is listed under a Views folder in the solution, which consists of Bases, Components, and Pages."

> "What is the purpose of this organization?

 "The purpose of this organization is to make it easier to shift reusable components and make it also easier to find these components based on their categories."

> "How are UI components organized in a solution?

 "UI components are listed under a Views folder in the solution with further subfolders for organization. The three subfolders are Bases for base-level components, Components for reusable UI components, and Pages for mandatory container components that allow end-users to navigate to specific routes. This tri-nature organization makes it easier to shift reusable components and find components based on their categories. Engineers can choose to break down these components further by folders/namespaces or leave them all at the same level depending on their preference."

> "What is the purpose of using subfolders in the Views folder for UI component organization?

 "The purpose of using subfolders in the Views folder is to organize UI components into separate categories for ease of access and maintainability. The Bases subfolder contains base-level components, the Components subfolder contains reusable UI components, and the Pages subfolder contains mandatory container components that allow end-users to navigate to specific routes. This organization method improves the ability to shift reusable components and make it easier to find components based on their categories."
